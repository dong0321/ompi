This README documents the features and options specific to the
**ORTE Level Failure Tolerant** PMIx Reference RunTime Environment (PRRTE)

[TOC]

Features
========
This implementation provides an orte level detector and propagator for fault
detection and propagation. Also has a new module in grpcomm using binaminal tree
to boardcast a message.


Building
======================
```bash
./autogen.pl

# before configure make sure you have external pmix and libevent installed,
# if you want to run mpi application you can use mpicc to build you binary
# and run with prun.  If you want to run mpi applications, you mpi and PRRTE
# should have the same version of PMIx

./configure --prefix=...  --with-pmix=/external-pmix-path --with-libevent= /external-libevent-path --enable-debug --enable-orterun-prefix-by-default

make [-j N] all install
#    use an integer value of N for parallel builds
```
There are many available configure options (see `./configure --help`
for a full list); a summary of the more commonly used ones is included
in the upstream Open MPI README file.

Running
=====================
## Building your application

Compile your application as usual
  1. using the provided `pcc` for pmix-based application
  2. using your "mpicc" for mpi-based application

## Running your application

You need to launch your daemons by `prte`

You can launch your application with by simply using the provided `prun`.
Make sure to set your `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` properly.

## Running under a batch scheduler

This code can operate under a job/batch scheduler, and is tested routinely with Slurm.
One difficulty comes from the fact that many job schedulers will "cleanup" the
application as soon as a process fails. In order to avoid this problem, it is preferred
that you use `-k` within an allocation (e.g. `salloc`, `sbatch`) rather than
a direct launch (e.g. `srun`).

## Run-time tuning knobs

This code comes with a variety of knobs for controlling how it runs. The default
parameters are sane and should result in very good performance in most
cases. You can change those default by '-pmca parameter value'

- `orte_enable_recovery <true|false> (default: true)` controls automatic
  cleanup of apps with failed processes within mpirun. The default
  differs from upstream Open MPI.

- 'orte_abort_non_zero_exit <true|false> (default: false)` controls the job
  termination after a error happpens.

- 'errmgr_detector_enable <true|false> (default: true)` enable or disable error
  detection and propagation.

## Tesing
=====================
Step 1: salloc -k -n x -w host1,host2...
        -k, --no-kill do not kill job on node failure

Step 2: prte -pmca errmgr_detector_heartbeat_period 0.5 -pmca errmgr_detector_heartbeat_timeout 1  -pmca errmgr_detector_enable 1
        using 'errmgr_detector_enable 1' choose enable the error detector.
        using '-debug-daemons' give more info about your job.
        Also you can using '-pmca componentname_base_verbose value' to get out put from that component.
        eg: ~/opt/git/resilient_pmix_reference/resilient_prrte_master/debug/bin/prte -pmca errmgr_detector_heartbeat_period 0.5 -pmca errmgr_detector_heartbeat_timeout 1  -pmca errmgr_detector_enable  1  -pmca odls_base_verbose 10 -pmca errmgr_base_verbose 10 -pmca propagate_base_verbose 10 bind-by node (this is exactly how i start the DVM)

        Also, the ring detector heartbeat sending frequency is not hard coded, you can change heartbeat_peroid and heartbeat_timeout by using mca params:
        eg:
        using '-pmca errmgr_detector_heartbeat_period 10' set the sending frequency to every 10 seconds(default is 5s)
        using '-pmca errmgr_detector_heartbeat_timeout 20' set timeout to 20 seconds(default is 10s)

Step 3: under example we have 2 test codes error_notify.c daemon_error_notify.c
        compile: pcc -g error_notify.c -o error_notify
        run: prun --oversubscribe -v error_notify

        if use external pmix compile as: pcc error_notify.c -o error_notify_1 -I/external_pmix_install_path/include -L/external_pmix_install_path/lib
        prun --oversubscribe  -x LD_LIBRARY_PATH error_notify_1 -v

       if use external pmix compile as: pcc daemon_error_notify.c -o daemon_error_notify_1 -I/external_pmix_install_path/include -L/external_pmix_install_path/lib
        prun --oversubscribe  -x LD_LIBRARY_PATH daemon_error_notify_1 -v
