This README documents the features and options specific to the
**ORTE Level Failure Tolerant** PMIx reference server implementation.

[TOC]

Features
========
This implementation provides an orte level detector and propagator for fault
detection and propagation. Also has a new module in grpcomm using binaminal tree
to boardcast a message.


Building
======================
```bash
./autogen.pl

./configure --prefix=...  --enable-debug --enable-orterun-prefix-by-default --no-create --no-recursion

make [-j N] all install
#    use an integer value of N for parallel builds
```
There are many available configure options (see `./configure --help`
for a full list); a summary of the more commonly used ones is included
in the upstream Open MPI README file.


Running
=====================
## Building your application

Compile your application as usual, using the provided `pcc`

## Running your application

You need to launch your daemons by `psrvr`

You can launch your application with fault tolerance by simply using the
provided `prun`. Beware that your distribution may already provide a
version of MPI, make sure to set your `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` properly.

## Running under a batch scheduler

This code can operate under a job/batch scheduler, and is tested routinely with Slurm.
One difficulty comes from the fact that many job schedulers will "cleanup" the
application as soon as a process fails. In order to avoid this problem, it is preferred
that you use `-k` within an allocation (e.g. `salloc`, `sbatch`) rather than
a direct launch (e.g. `srun`).

## Run-time tuning knobs

This code comes with a variety of knobs for controlling how it runs. The default
parameters are sane and should result in very good performance in most
cases. You can change those default by '-pmca parameter value'

- `orte_enable_recovery <true|false> (default: true)` controls automatic
  cleanup of apps with failed processes within mpirun. The default
  differs from upstream Open MPI.

- 'orte_abort_non_zero_exit <true|false> (default: false)` controls the job
  termination after a error happpens.

- 'errmgr_detector_enable <true|false> (default: true)` enable or disable error
  detection and propagation.

## Tesing
=====================
Step 1: salloc -k -n x -w host1,host2...
        -k, --no-kill do not kill job on node failure

Step 2: psrvr -pmca pmix pmix3x -pmca grpcomm bmg  -debug-daemons
        using '-pmca pmix pmix3x' choose pmix3x as dafault pmix module.
        using '-pmca grpcomm bmg' choose bmg as dafault grpcomm module(binominal graph)
        using '-debug-daemons' give more info about your job.
        Also you can using '-pmca componentname_base_verbose value' to get out put from that component.
        eg: psrvr -pmca pmix pmix3x -pmca grpcomm bmg -pmca odls_base_verbose 10 -pmca errmgr_base_verbose 10 -pmca propagate_base_verbose 10  -debug-daemons

Step 3: under example we have a test code error_notify.c
        compile: pcc -g error_notify.c -o error_notify
        run: prun --oversubscribe -v error_notify
