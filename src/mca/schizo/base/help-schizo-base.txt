[incorrect-env-list-param]
WARNING: The format of "mca_base_env_list" parameter is a delimited list of VAR=VAL or
VAR instances. By default, the delimiter is a semicolon: VAR1=VAL1;VAR2;VAR3=VAL3;...
You can set other via "mca_base_env_list_delimiter" parameter. If the delimiter is a
semicolon, the value of "mca_base_env_list" variable should be quoted to not interfere
with SHELL command line parsing. In the case where a value is not assigned to variable
VAR, the value will be taken from the current environment.
The following environment variable was not found in the environment:
  Variable:             %s
  MCA variable value:   %s
#
[env-not-found]
An environmental variable was requested to be forwarded, but was not found:

  Variable:  %s

This may result in unexpected behavior.
